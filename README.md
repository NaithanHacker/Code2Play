# Code2Play
Turning Code into Fun - A Game Development repository where ideas becomes playable experiences.

Code2Play is an open-world, game-based learning platform designed to make programming interactive, engaging, and fun.
Inspired by games like GTA V and Minecraft, this project allows users to learn programming languages by completing real coding missions inside a virtual world.
Instead of traditional tutorials, users learn by playing, exploring, and solving problems.
